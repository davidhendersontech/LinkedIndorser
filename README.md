# LinkedInEndorser

Your friends are awesome! We know, you know it, potential employers don't.   
LinkedInEndorser fixes all of that by automatically endorsing all of your    
friends skills on their profile.

## Install
1. Simply install the greasemonkey addon in your favorite browser.
2. Click the monkey, click new user script.
3. Copy the contents of LinkedInEndorser.js into the new script that just opened
4. Go to your coworkers LinkedIn page and watch the magic happen

### todo
If I have more time I might come back and try to add these features:   
- [ ] Check if skills have already been endorsed before endorsing
- [ ] Allow users to give a list of profiles and endorse all profiles

### Disclaimer and contact

I made this for fun in about an hour (coincidentally how long it took me to manually endorse everything).   
I wanted to learn how to run external javascript on a webpage and manipulate their dom.   
The script will only run on linked user profiles. Since it doesn't check if you've already endorsed   
please disable the script when not in use. YOUVE BEEN WARNED!
